    <h1 style="counter-reset: h1 3;">Running</h1>
    <p>
        You can run a job either by clicking on the run button, or by using the Run option in the Run menu.
    </p>
    <h2 id="messages">Messages</h2>
    <p>
        As the job progresses, the actions will emit various messages, which will be displayed in the messages tab.
    </p>
    <p>
        At the top of the tab are the filter buttons, which allow you to choose which message types to display - the 
      message type is shown in the final column.
    </p>
    <h2 id="stepping">Stepping</h2>
    <p>
        Another option for running jobs is to step through it. In this mode, execution pauses after each action, giving 
      you a chance to check that it has done what you expect.  To continue with the next action, either select "Step"
      from the run menu again, or click the Run button, which will now be labeled "step".

    <h2 id="debugging">Debugging</h2>
    <p>
        Debugging centipede jobs is a lot like solving problems in any other domain, and can be split into three steps:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <h3>Identify the problem</h3>
            <p>
                Determine why the expected behavour isn't happening.  This will generally involve
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Stepping through the job</li>
                <li>Adding messagebox actions to check the value of variables</li>
                <li>Comparing actions within centipede to those outside</li>
                <li>Graphing the progam flow - are the branch actions doing what you expect</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Identify solutions</h3>
            <p>What do you need to do to fix the problem identified above?</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Implement and test</h3>
            <p>
                Make the change, and check it works correctly.  If not, return to step 1.
            </p>
        </li>
    </ol>
