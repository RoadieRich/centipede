        <span class="introduction">Centipede is a tool for automating repetitive computer based tasks, the sort of tasks that involve moving 
        data from one place to another, or from one piece of software to another.</span class="introduction">
    </p>
    <p>
      For example: You can use Centipede to create a new document, starting with a document template and 
      completing it using data from another source. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Centipede jobs contain actions, each action does one small and specific thing, and you can build jobs from 
      any combination of actions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Data is stored within Centipede variables.  Variables are available to all actions that follow.  
    </p>
    <p>
      The Centipede application window is divided into four panels:

      <ul>
        <li>
          The information panel, which displays the welcome message on startup, tutorials, or any html file 
          assigned by the current Centipede job for providing information about the job
        </li>
        <li>
          The action panel, which displays the actions that make up the current Centipede job
        </li>
        <li>
          The action toolbox, which displays all available actions in tabbed categories
        </li>
        <li>
          The output panel, which displays any messages generated by the actions, and the current value of any 
          Centipede variables
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
