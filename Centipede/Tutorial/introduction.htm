	    <p>Centipede is a tool for automating repetitive computer based tasks, the sort of tasks that involve moving data from one piece of software, database or document to another.
        </p>
        <p>For example: You can use Centipede to create a new document, starting with a document template and completing it using data from another source. 
        </p>
	    <p>Centipede jobs contain actions, each action does one small and specific thing, and you can build jobs from any combination of actions.  When a job is run, actions are processed in order.  Flow control actions provide the possibility for looping and branching.
        </p>
        <p>Data is stored within Centipede variables, and variables are available to all actions that follow.  
        </p>
        <p>The Centipede application window is divided into four panels:
        </p>
        <ul>
        <li>The information panel, which displays the welcome message on startup, tutorials, or any html file assigned by the current Centipede job for providing information about the job</li>
        <li>The action editor panel, which displays the actions that make up the current Centipede job</li>
        <li>The action toolbox panel, which displays all available actions in categories</li>
        <li>The output panel, which displays any messages generated by the actions, and the current value of any Centipede variables</li>
        </ul>
