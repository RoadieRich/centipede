        <p>
            Centipede jobs contain actions, each action does one small and specific thing, and you can build jobs from any combination of actions.
        </p>
        <p>
            Actions that control other software applications are implemented using plugins, so for example: If you want to use Centipede to control a Microsoft® Office document, then you will need to have both Office software and also the Centipede Office plugin installed.
        </p>
        <p>
            Actions from all available plugins are displayed within category tabs in the action toolbox.
        </p>
		<h2 id="adding">Adding</h2>
	    <p>
            To add an action to a Centipede job, double click the required action in the action toolbox, or drag it into the action editor panel. 
        </p>
		<h2 id="deleting" >Deleting</h2>
	    <p>
            To delete an action from a Centipede job, right-click the action and select Delete.
        </p>
        <h2 id="reordering" >Reordering</h2>
        <p>
            Reordering actions is planned, but is not currently supported.
